## 🚨 CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED

### 1. **Database Choice** ✅ **DECIDED: PostgreSQL on RDS**
**Decision:** PostgreSQL on RDS

**Why PostgreSQL:**
- ✅ Complex relationships (groups → members → approvals)
- ✅ Multi-table transactions for approval workflows
- ✅ Better for complex queries (audit logs, calendar responsibility lines)
- ✅ Easier to reason about for this use case

**Database Schema:** See README.md Section 4 (23 tables fully defined)
**Schema Files:**
- Complete schema: `README.md` Section 4
- Standalone SQL: `database/schema.sql` (to be created)
- Migration scripts: Will use Prisma or Knex migrations

---

### 2. **ORM/Query Builder Choice** ✅ **DECIDED: Prisma**
**Decision:** Prisma

**Why Prisma:**
- ✅ Great JSDoc support with auto-generated types
- ✅ Type-safe database access
- ✅ Automatic migrations
- ✅ Excellent developer experience
- ✅ Best for PostgreSQL

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install -D prisma
npm install @prisma/client
npx prisma init
# Convert database/schema.sql to prisma/schema.prisma
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

---

### 3. **Validation Library** ✅ **DECIDED: Joi**
**Decision:** Joi

**Why Joi:**
- ✅ More expressive, easier to read
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Mature, widely used
- ✅ Great for complex validation rules (approval logic, finance calculations)

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install joi
```

---

### 4. **Mobile App Framework** ✅ **DECIDED: React Native with Expo**
**Decision:** React Native using Expo framework

**Why React Native:**
- ✅ Better native performance
- ✅ Larger community, more libraries
- ✅ Better gesture support (critical for calendar swipes)
- ✅ Native navigation feels better

**Why Expo:**
- ✅ **No Xcode/Android Studio required for development!**
- ✅ Cloud builds (EAS Build) - builds iOS/Android for you
- ✅ Faster development iteration
- ✅ All needed features supported (push notifications, camera, file uploads, etc.)
- ✅ Can eject to bare React Native later if needed
- 💰 Free tier available, EAS Build ~$29/month or pay-per-build

**Setup:**
```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest mobile
cd mobile
npm install
npm start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app to test on your phone
```

**Building for App Stores:**
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build:configure

# Build iOS (no Mac needed!)
eas build --platform ios

# Build Android
eas build --platform android

# Submit to app stores
eas submit --platform ios
eas submit --platform android
```

---

### 5. **State Management** ✅ **DECIDED: Redux Toolkit**
**Decision:** Redux Toolkit

**Why Redux Toolkit:**
- ✅ Handles complex state (offline sync, message caching)
- ✅ DevTools for debugging (critical for complex approval workflows)
- ✅ Middleware for side effects (API calls, storage)
- ✅ Redux Persist for offline support
- ✅ Best for apps with complex data flow (your app qualifies)

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux redux-persist
```

## 📋 PENDING REQUIREMENTS CLARIFICATIONS

### Business Logic Questions

#### 1. **Subscription & Storage** ✅ **DECIDED**
- [✅] **Q:** When storage exceeds limit, should we:
  - **DECISION: C) Automatically charge for additional storage + send email notification**
  - Implementation: Charge $1 per 2GB, send email: "Your storage has been increased to XGB. You'll be charged $X on your next billing cycle."

- [✅] **Q:** If an admin cancels subscription mid-month, when does access end?
  - **DECISION: B) End of billing period**
  - Ensures legal continuity for co-parenting documentation

- [✅] **Q:** Can a group have zero admins temporarily?
  - **DECISION: No - Groups require at least one admin**
  - **Special case:** If only admin unsubscribes:
    - Show banner to all group members: "This group will be deleted on [DATE] because [ADMIN NAME]'s subscription ends then"
    - Nothing permanently deleted from servers
    - Resurrection possible via support ticket
    - Ex-admin can re-subscribe to restore access

#### 2. **Group Deletion & Data Retention** ✅ **DECIDED**
- [✅] **Q:** When the last admin leaves a group, what happens?
  - **DECISION: C) Cannot remove last admin without deleting group (from user perspective)**
  - **Server-side:** Nothing is ever permanently deleted
  - **Implementation:**
    - UI prevents last admin from leaving
    - If last admin's subscription expires, group becomes "archived" for users
    - All data remains on servers indefinitely
    - Resurrection available via support ticket
  - **Legal consideration:** Co-parenting data preserved for custody cases

- [✅] **Q:** Can ex-admins request historical log exports after leaving?
  - **DECISION: No - Must become admin again to access logs**
  - Recommendation: Download all logs before leaving admin role

#### 3. **Approval Workflow Edge Cases** ✅ **DECIDED**
- [✅] **Q:** If 3 admins, and votes are 1 approve, 1 reject, 1 no vote - what happens?
  - **DECISION: B) Wait for all votes**
  - **Exception:** For actions requiring >50%, as soon as >50% threshold is reached, action passes immediately (no need to wait for remaining votes)
  - **Example:** 5 admins, need >50% (3 votes)
    - 3 approve → Action passes immediately
    - 2 approve, 3 reject → Action rejected immediately
    - 2 approve, 1 reject, 2 no vote yet → Wait for more votes

- [✅] **Q:** Can the requesting admin vote on their own approval?
  - **DECISION: Yes - Requesting admin is part of the approval pool**
  - They can vote approve or reject on their own request
  - Still requires other admins to meet threshold

#### 4. **Calendar & Responsibility Tracking** ✅ **DECIDED**
- [✅] **Q:** Can a child have overlapping responsibility events?
  - **DECISION: B) Prevent overlaps, require resolution**
  - **Implementation:**
    - When creating new responsibility event, check for overlaps
    - If overlap detected, show error: "This conflicts with existing event [EVENT NAME] from [TIME] to [TIME]"
    - User must resolve (edit existing event or choose different time)
  - **Rationale:** Clear accountability - one person responsible at any given time

- [✅] **Q:** Timezone handling for events:
  - **DECISION: A) Events stored in UTC, displayed in user's local time**
  - **Implementation:**
    - Database stores all timestamps in UTC
    - Mobile app converts to device timezone for display
    - Calendar event shows: "6:00 PM (your time)" vs "9:00 PM (EST)"
  - **Example:** Custody handoff at "6pm" means 6pm in the user's local time

#### 5. **Finance Matters** ✅ **DECIDED**
- [✅] **Q:** Can finance matters have multiple currencies?
  - **DECISION: B) No, one currency per group**
  - **Rationale:** Users can do currency conversion calculations themselves
  - **Implementation:** Group settings has default currency, all finance matters in that group use same currency
  - **Future:** Could add currency converter in MVP2

- [✅] **Q:** What happens if someone overpays?
  - **DECISION: B) Reject payment, must match exact amount**
  - **Error message:** "Payment amount ($100) exceeds what you owe ($50). Please enter $50 or less."
  - **Workaround:** User can create a separate finance matter to request money back from the person they paid
  - **Example:**
    - Person A owes Person B $50
    - Person A accidentally paid $100
    - Person A creates new finance matter: "Overpayment refund - $50" where Person B owes Person A $50

#### 6. **PH Messenger Permissions** ✅ **DECIDED**
- [✅] **Q:** Can PH Messenger users create new message groups?
  - **DECISION: A) Yes, if their role allows (same rules as main app)**
  - Implementation: Check `group_settings.{role}_create_message_groups`
  - Parents & Caregivers: Default YES
  - Children: Default NO (can be changed by admin)

- [✅] **Q:** Can PH Messenger users invite others to message groups?
  - **DECISION: A) Yes, same rules as main app**
  - Can invite any member of the parent group to message group
  - May require admin approval depending on permissions matrix

- [✅] **Q:** Can supervisors use PH Messenger?
  - **DECISION: B) No, blocked**
  - Supervisors cannot send messages, so PH Messenger serves no purpose
  - If supervisor tries to open PH Messenger, show: "Supervisors cannot use PH Messenger. Please use the main Parenting Helper app for read-only access."

- [✅] **Q:** If user has both apps, do they share local data?
  - **DECISION: A) Yes, shared Redux Persist storage**
  - Same authentication token
  - Same message cache (offline access)
  - Logged actions track which app was used (audit logs)

#### 7. **Messaging** ✅ **DECIDED**
- [✅] **Q:** Message edit time limit?
  - **DECISION: C) No edits, only delete (hide)**
  - **Rationale:** Prevents message tampering in legal/custody contexts
  - **Implementation:**
    - No "Edit" button on messages
    - Only "Delete" button (which hides message, doesn't actually delete)
    - Deleted messages remain visible to admins (greyed out)
    - If user needs to correct message, they send a new one
  - **Future:** Could add "Correct this message" feature that sends new message with reference to old one

- [✅] **Q:** Media retention after sender leaves group:
  - **DECISION: A) Media remains available**
  - **Everything that happens on the app is backed up, in the logs, and tracked**
  - **Implementation:**
    - Media files stay in S3
    - URLs remain valid
    - Audit logs preserve media links
    - Sender name anonymized in UI: "[Former Member]"
  - **Legal consideration:** Evidence preservation for custody cases

**Complexity:** Low (already tracking per-group storage)

---

### Security Suggestions

#### 1. **Two-Factor Authentication for Admins**
**Suggestion:** Require 2FA for admin role (beyond email MFA for login)
**Why:** Admin actions are high-stakes (custody, finance)
**Complexity:** Medium (Kinde supports this)

#### 2. **Audit Log Access Logging**
**Suggestion:** Log who accessed/downloaded audit logs
**Why:** Meta-logging for legal compliance
**Complexity:** Low

#### 3. **Session Timeout**
**Suggestion:** Auto-logout after 30 minutes of inactivity
**Why:** Security on shared devices
**Complexity:** Low

#### 4. **Suspicious Activity Alerts**
**Suggestion:** Alert admins if:
- Many messages deleted in short time
- Bulk member removals
- Large file uploads
**Why:** Detect abuse or account compromise
**Complexity:** Medium

---

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. **Message Pagination Strategy**
**Current plan:** 50 messages per page
**Suggestion:** Use cursor-based pagination instead of offset
**Why:** Better performance with large message groups (1000+ messages)
**Complexity:** Low

#### 2. **Calendar Pre-fetching**
**Suggestion:** Pre-fetch next/previous month when user views calendar
**Why:** Faster swipe navigation
**Complexity:** Low

#### 3. **Image Compression**
**Suggestion:** Compress images client-side before upload
- Original → stored in S3 (for audit)
- Compressed → shown in app (faster load)
**Why:** Reduce bandwidth, faster loading
**Complexity:** Medium

#### 4. **Database Indexing Strategy**
**Suggestion:** Monitor slow queries in first month, add indexes as needed
**Why:** Premature optimization vs. data-driven optimization
**Complexity:** Ongoing
