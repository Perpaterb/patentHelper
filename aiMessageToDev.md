## üö® CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED

### 1. **Database Choice - MUST DECIDE**
**Question:** PostgreSQL on RDS or DynamoDB?

**Current Recommendation:** PostgreSQL on RDS
- ‚úÖ Complex relationships (groups ‚Üí members ‚Üí approvals)
- ‚úÖ Multi-table transactions for approval workflows
- ‚úÖ Better for complex queries (audit logs, calendar responsibility lines)
- ‚úÖ Easier to reason about for this use case

**DynamoDB Alternative:**
- ‚úÖ More "serverless" (scales to zero)
- ‚úÖ Lower costs at small scale
- ‚ùå Harder to model complex relationships
- ‚ùå No native JOIN support (requires denormalization)
- ‚ùå Approval voting logic would be complex

**DECISION NEEDED:** Which database should we use?

---

### 2. **ORM/Query Builder Choice**
**Options:**
1. **Prisma** (Recommended)
   - ‚úÖ Great TypeScript/JSDoc support
   - ‚úÖ Type-safe database access
   - ‚úÖ Automatic migrations
   - ‚úÖ Excellent developer experience

2. **Knex.js**
   - ‚úÖ More flexible query builder
   - ‚úÖ Lighter weight
   - ‚ùå Less type safety

3. **Raw pg (node-postgres)**
   - ‚úÖ Maximum control
   - ‚ùå More boilerplate
   - ‚ùå No type safety

**DECISION NEEDED:** Which ORM/query builder?

---

### 3. **Validation Library**
**Options:**
1. **Joi** (Recommended for this project)
   - ‚úÖ More expressive, easier to read
   - ‚úÖ Better error messages
   - ‚úÖ Mature, widely used

2. **Zod**
   - ‚úÖ Better TypeScript integration (less relevant for JS project)
   - ‚úÖ Lighter weight
   - ‚úÖ Can infer types (not needed for pure JS)

**DECISION NEEDED:** Joi or Zod?

---

### 4. **Mobile App Framework**
**Question:** React Native or Capacitor?

**Current Recommendation:** React Native
- ‚úÖ Better native performance
- ‚úÖ Larger community, more libraries
- ‚úÖ Better gesture support (critical for calendar swipes)
- ‚úÖ Native navigation feels better
- ‚ùå Requires native build setup (Xcode, Android Studio)

**Capacitor Alternative:**
- ‚úÖ Easier setup (web-first)
- ‚úÖ Can use any web framework
- ‚ùå Performance not as good for complex UI
- ‚ùå Gestures not as smooth

**DECISION NEEDED:** React Native or Capacitor?

---

### 5. **State Management**
**Options:**
1. **Redux Toolkit** (Recommended for this project)
   - ‚úÖ Handles complex state (offline sync, message caching)
   - ‚úÖ DevTools for debugging
   - ‚úÖ Middleware for side effects

2. **Zustand**
   - ‚úÖ Simpler, less boilerplate
   - ‚úÖ Good for medium complexity

## üìã PENDING REQUIREMENTS CLARIFICATIONS

### Business Logic Questions

#### 1. **Subscription & Storage**
- [ ] **Q:** When storage exceeds limit, should we:
  - A) Block all new uploads immediately?
  - B) Allow a grace period (e.g., 7 days)?
  - C) Automatically charge for additional storage?
  - **Current Assumption:** Block uploads, warn at 80%

- [ ] **Q:** If an admin cancels subscription mid-month, when does access end?
  - A) Immediately
  - B) End of billing period (recommended for legal continuity)
  - **Current Assumption:** End of billing period

- [ ] **Q:** Can a group have zero admins temporarily?
  - **Context:** If only admin requests to leave and it's pending approval
  - **Current Assumption:** No, system prevents this

#### 2. **Group Deletion & Data Retention**
- [ ] **Q:** When the last admin leaves a group, what happens?
  - A) Group is soft-deleted, data preserved indefinitely
  - B) Group is marked for deletion after 30 days
  - C) Cannot remove last admin without deleting group
  - **Legal implication:** Co-parenting data may be needed for custody cases years later

- [ ] **Q:** Can ex-admins request historical log exports after leaving?
  - **Context:** They paid for storage during their admin period
  - **Current Assumption:** No access after leaving, should download logs before leaving

#### 3. **Approval Workflow Edge Cases**
- [ ] **Q:** If 3 admins, and votes are 1 approve, 1 reject, 1 no vote - what happens?
  - A) Rejection wins (safer default)
  - B) Wait for all votes
  - C) Wait for timeout (e.g., 7 days), then reject
  - **Current Assumption:** Rejection wins in tie

- [ ] **Q:** Can the requesting admin vote on their own approval?
  - **Context:** Admin A requests to add member, Admin A is part of approval pool
  - **Current Assumption:** Yes, they can vote (but can't single-handedly approve)

#### 4. **Calendar & Responsibility Tracking**
- [ ] **Q:** Can a child have overlapping responsibility events?
  - **Example:** Child at school (9-3pm) but also "with Dad" (all day)
  - A) Allow overlaps, show both
  - B) Prevent overlaps, require resolution
  - **Current Assumption:** Allow overlaps, latest event takes precedence for display

- [ ] **Q:** Timezone handling for events:
  - **Scenario:** Parent A (PST) and Parent B (EST) in same group
  - A) Events stored in UTC, displayed in user's local time
  - B) Events tied to a specific timezone
  - **Current Assumption:** UTC storage, local display

#### 5. **Finance Matters**
- [ ] **Q:** Can finance matters have multiple currencies?
  - **Example:** "Vacation expenses - $500 USD + ‚Ç¨200 EUR"
  - A) Yes, each matter can specify currency
  - B) No, one currency per group
  - **Current Assumption:** One currency per matter (no multi-currency in MVP1)

- [ ] **Q:** What happens if someone overpays?
  - **Example:** Expected $50, paid $100
  - A) Track overpayment, show "+$50 credit"
  - B) Reject payment, must match exact amount
  - **Current Assumption:** Allow and track overpayment

#### 6. **Messaging**
- [ ] **Q:** Message edit time limit?
  - A) Can edit anytime (logged in audit)
  - B) 15 minutes after send
  - C) No edits, only delete (hide)
  - **Current Assumption:** Can edit anytime, all edits logged

- [ ] **Q:** Media retention after sender leaves group:
  - A) Media remains available
  - B) Media deleted with user
  - **Legal consideration:** Evidence preservation
  - **Current Assumption:** Media remains, user anonymized in logs

```
Current: On/Off for each category
Suggested:
- Immediate (push + email)
- Daily digest (email)
- Off
```
**Why:** Reduces notification fatigue, increases user retention

#### 2. **Message Draft Auto-Save**
**Suggestion:** Auto-save message drafts every 5 seconds
**Why:** Prevents data loss if app crashes, better UX

#### 3. **Offline Mode for Reading**
**Suggestion:** Cache last 50 messages per message group for offline reading
**Why:** Parents often in low-signal areas (schools, hospitals)
**Complexity:** Medium (Redux Persist + sync logic)

#### 4. **Export Finance Matters to PDF**
**Suggestion:** Allow exporting finance matter as PDF for tax purposes
**Why:** Common use case - childcare expenses for tax deductions
**Complexity:** Low (use library like pdfkit)

#### 5. **Calendar Event Templates**
**Suggestion:** Pre-defined templates for common events:
- "School pickup"
- "Doctor appointment"
- "Weekend with [parent]"
**Why:** Saves time, reduces errors
**Complexity:** Low

#### 6. **Batch Operations for Admins**
**Suggestion:** Allow admins to approve/reject multiple pending approvals at once
**Why:** With many approvals, one-by-one is tedious
**Complexity:** Medium

#### 7. **Add "Temporary Caregiver" Role**
**Suggestion:** Time-limited caregiver role (e.g., babysitter for weekend)
**Why:** Avoid cluttering member list with temporary people
**Implementation:** Add `role_expires_at` field
**Complexity:** Low

#### 8. **Smart Storage Warnings**
**Suggestion:** Warn user which groups are using most storage
**Why:** Helps identify where to clean up
**Complexity:** Low (already tracking per-group storage)

---

### Security Suggestions

#### 1. **Two-Factor Authentication for Admins**
**Suggestion:** Require 2FA for admin role (beyond email MFA for login)
**Why:** Admin actions are high-stakes (custody, finance)
**Complexity:** Medium (Kinde supports this)

#### 2. **Audit Log Access Logging**
**Suggestion:** Log who accessed/downloaded audit logs
**Why:** Meta-logging for legal compliance
**Complexity:** Low

#### 3. **Session Timeout**
**Suggestion:** Auto-logout after 30 minutes of inactivity
**Why:** Security on shared devices
**Complexity:** Low

#### 4. **Suspicious Activity Alerts**

- Many messages deleted in short time
- Bulk member removals
- Large file uploads
**Why:** Detect abuse or account compromise
**Complexity:** Medium

---

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. **Message Pagination Strategy**
**Current plan:** 50 messages per page
**Suggestion:** Use cursor-based pagination instead of offset
**Why:** Better performance with large message groups (1000+ messages)
**Complexity:** Low

#### 2. **Calendar Pre-fetching**
**Suggestion:** Pre-fetch next/previous month when user views calendar
**Why:** Faster swipe navigation
**Complexity:** Low

#### 3. **Image Compression**
**Suggestion:** Compress images client-side before upload
