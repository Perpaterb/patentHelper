## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Project

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Perpaterb/patentHelper
2. Click **"Projects"** tab at the top
3. Click **"New project"**
4. Choose **"Board"** view
5. Name it: **"Parenting Helper - MVP1 Development"**
6. Click **"Create"**

### Step 2: Configure Columns

GitHub Projects will create default columns. Modify them:

1. **Rename/Create these columns** (drag to reorder):
   - `ðŸ“‹ Backlog` - Tasks not yet prioritized
   - `ðŸŽ¯ Ready` - Prioritized, ready to work on
   - `ðŸš§ In Progress` - Currently working on
   - `ðŸ§ª Testing` - Code complete, needs testing
   - `âœ… Done` - Completed and merged

2. **To rename a column:**
   - Click the `...` menu on the column header
   - Select "Rename"

3. **To add a column:**
   - Click `+` button on the right side
   - Name it and choose a preset (or none)

### Step 3: Add Labels to Repository

Go to your repository â†’ **Issues** â†’ **Labels** â†’ **New label**

Create these labels:

| Label | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `web-app` | `#0E8A16` (green) | Admin web app features |

| `infrastructure` | `#D93F0B` (orange) | AWS/Terraform |
| `bug` | `#D73A4A` (red) | Bug fixes |
| `documentation` | `#0075CA` (blue) | Documentation updates |
| `high-priority` | `#B60205` (dark red) | Urgent/blocking |
| `enhancement` | `#A2EEEF` (light blue) | Nice-to-have improvements |

### Step 4: Create Initial Issues

4. The issue will appear in the first column

### Step 6: Automate Workflow (Optional)

Go to your project â†’ **"..."** menu â†’ **"Workflows"**

## ðŸ“‹ Using the Board

### Moving Cards

**Drag and drop** cards between columns as you work:
- New task â†’ Starts in **Backlog**
- Ready to code â†’ Move to **Ready**
- Start working â†’ Move to **In Progress**
- Code complete â†’ Move to **Testing**
- Tested and merged â†’ Move to **Done**

### Viewing Issues

Click any card to see full issue details, comments, and links.

### Filtering

Use the **Filter** button to show:
- Only `web-app` issues
- Only `high-priority` issues
- Issues assigned to you
- etc.

### Adding Notes

You can add **draft cards** (notes without creating full issues):
1. Click **"+"** button in any column
2. Type a quick note
3. Later, convert to a full issue if needed

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Workflow

### Daily
1. Check **In Progress** column - finish what you started
2. Pick next task from **Ready** column
3. Update card status as you progress

### Weekly
1. Review **Backlog** - prioritize for next week
2. Move prioritized tasks to **Ready**
3. Review **Done** - celebrate progress!

### When Creating Issues
1. Use templates (Bug, Feature, Task)
2. Add appropriate labels
3. Link to project (appears in sidebar)
4. Add to **Backlog** column

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

### Break Down Large Features
Instead of one huge "Build messaging" issue, create smaller issues:
- `[TASK] Create message database queries`
- `[TASK] Build message list UI component`
- `[TASK] Implement message sending`
- `[TASK] Add message read receipts`

### Use Milestones
Create milestones for each Phase:
- **Milestone: Phase 1 - Foundation** (2 weeks)
- **Milestone: Phase 2 - Web App** (4 weeks)
- etc.

Assign issues to milestones to track phase progress.

### Reference Issues in Commits
When committing, reference the issue:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add Stripe subscription form (#4)"
```

The `#4` links the commit to issue #4.

### Use Templates
The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` folder has templates for:
- Features
- Bugs
- Tasks

When creating a new issue, choose the appropriate template.

**ðŸ“‹ Backlog** (30 cards)
- All Phase 2-6 features
- Future enhancements

**ðŸŽ¯ Ready** (5 cards)
- Next week's tasks
- Prioritized by importance

**ðŸš§ In Progress** (2-3 cards)
- Currently coding
- Don't have too many here - focus!

**ðŸ§ª Testing** (1 card)
- Code written, testing locally

**âœ… Done** (10 cards)
- Completed Phase 1 tasks
- Recent wins

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**Can't see Projects tab?**
- Make sure you're on the repository page
- Check repo settings â†’ Features â†’ Projects is enabled

**Cards not showing up?**
- Make sure issue is linked to project (check issue sidebar)
- Refresh the page

**Want to use a different view?**
- Click **"Table"** or **"Roadmap"** view at the top
- Board view is usually best for development
