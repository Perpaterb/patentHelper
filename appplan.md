**3 Products, 1 Backend (KISS Principle)**

This platform consists of 3 separate products sharing one backend:

1. **Admin Web App** (parentinghelperapp.com) - React web application
   - Subscription management & payments (Stripe)
   - Storage upgrades & billing
   - Log exports
   - My Account management
   - BUILT FIRST (no payments in mobile apps)

2. **Parenting Helper Mobile App** - React Native (iOS + Android)
   - Full features: messaging, calendar, finance, admin
   - NO payment features (links to web app for subscriptions)
   - BUILT SECOND (after web app)

3. **PH Messenger Mobile App** - React Native (iOS + Android)
   - Messaging only, biometric auth
   - For children and restricted devices
   - BUILT THIRD (after main app)

**Pricing:**
This app can be used by any non-group admin parent for free. Anyone wanting to administer a group which includes having access to a backup, images, videos and the logs of each group will need a subscription of **$4 USD per month** (managed via web app). This gets them 10GB of storage. Each additional GB of storage over the 10GB limit will be an extra **$1 USD per month** (metered billing).

**Competitive Advantage:** Our main competitor charges $9 USD/month - we're offering the same features for less than half the price.

**20-Day Free Trial:**
- New users (age 16+) automatically get 20-day free trial with **full admin access**
- **NO RESTRICTIONS during trial** - full admin features available
- Trial users can create groups and be admin
- Can add multiple admins during trial (restriction removed)
- **Visibility Banner (shown to ALL group members):**
  - Text: "[Admin Name] needs to subscribe in X days or this group will be archived"
  - Colors change based on urgency: Yellow (days 20-6), Orange (days 5-2), Red (day 1)
  - Location: Top of group screen (persistent until subscription)
  - "Remind [Admin]" button sends notification to trial admin
- **Post-trial behavior:**
  - Admin subscribes: Banner removed, group continues normally
  - Trial expires: Group archived (read-only), data preserved, can reactivate by subscribing

**Storage Management Rules:**
- Base plan: 10GB included at $4 USD/month
- Overage: $1 USD per GB over 10GB limit (metered billing via Stripe)
- When storage exceeds limit: Automatically charge for additional GB ($1 USD per GB)
- Send email notification: "Your storage has been increased to XGB. You'll be charged $X USD on your next billing cycle"
- Show warning at 80% capacity in My Account
- Additional Storage card displays "Automatically charged as needed" (no manual add storage button)
- Storage tracked per admin across all their groups
- All prices displayed as $USD (e.g., "$4.00 USD/month") for currency clarity

**Storage Cleanup Tool (Admin Feature):**
Admins need tools to manage their storage and avoid overage charges. The Storage Cleanup screen provides:

1. **Storage Overview Dashboard:**
   - Total storage used across all groups
   - Storage breakdown by group
   - Storage breakdown by type (images, videos, documents, audit logs)
   - Visual progress bar showing usage vs. 10GB limit
   - Cost calculator: "You're using 12.3GB = $4 base + $2.30 overage = $6.30/month"

2. **File Browser with Sorting & Filtering:**
   - Sort by: Size (largest first), Date (oldest first), Type, Group
   - Filter by: File type (images/videos/documents), Date range, Specific group
   - Search by: Filename, Group name
   - List view shows: Thumbnail/preview, filename, size, date uploaded, group name, file type

3. **Bulk Selection & Deletion:**
   - Checkbox selection for multiple files
   - "Select All" / "Deselect All" buttons
   - "Select all files over 5MB" quick action
   - "Select all files older than 1 year" quick action
   - Bulk delete button with confirmation dialog
   - Shows space that will be freed: "Delete 23 files (456 MB)"

4. **File Preview & Details:**
   - Click file to preview (images show full size, videos show player)
   - File metadata: Uploaded by, uploaded date, associated message/event, group
   - Context link: "View in Messages" or "View in Finance" to see where file is used
   - Individual delete button per file

5. **Safety Features:**
   - **Audit log exports are PROTECTED** - cannot be deleted via cleanup tool
   - Files associated with active finance matters show warning: "This file is part of an active payment dispute"
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion: "Are you sure? This will permanently delete X files (YMB)"
   - Deleted files removed from S3 immediately (no soft delete for storage optimization)

6. **Recommendations Engine:**
   - "You have 45 images over 5MB. Consider compressing or deleting."
   - "23 videos from 2023 are taking up 3.2GB. Review old videos?"
   - "Oldest files: 156 files from 2022 (1.8GB)"

**Technical Implementation:**
- Web admin app only (primary use case)
- Backend endpoint: `GET /storage/analysis` - Returns file list with metadata
- Backend endpoint: `DELETE /storage/files` - Bulk delete with file IDs array
- S3 integration: Direct delete from bucket, update storage_usage table
- Real-time storage recalculation after deletion

**Subscription Cancellation:**
- Access ends at end of current billing period (not immediately)
- Ensures legal continuity for co-parenting documentation

**Group Admin Requirements:**
- Groups require at least one admin at all times - UI prevents last admin from leaving
- If last admin's subscription expires: Show banner "Group will be archived on [DATE] because [ADMIN]'s subscription ends"
- Nothing permanently deleted from servers - resurrection via support ticket possible 

In "my account"  there would need to be a storage tracker. to show and warn what it is costing them. It will be changed monthly.

**Technology Stack:**
- Web App: React (deployed to AWS S3 + CloudFront)
- Mobile Apps: React Native with Expo (iOS + Android for MVP1)
- Backend: Serverless infrastructure on AWS
- Storage: AWS S3
- Server functions: AWS Lambda (production) + Docker (dev)
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Authentication: Kinde (email + MFA)
- Payments: Stripe (web app only)

**Core Functionalities:**
Mobile apps provide 3 main features:
1. Messaging
2. Calendar (with child responsibility tracking)
3. Finance (payment tracking, NOT payment processing)

Web app provides admin features:
1. Subscription management
2. Payment processing
3. Storage upgrades
4. Log exports
5. My Account settings

All Accounts can have different roles in different groups but only one role per group

No groups or messages can ever be deleted. They can only be hidden from non group admins. People can be allowed to "delete" their own messages but they are still visible to admins with hidden symbols on them and they are a little greyed out.

Every change message edits,,, everything that happens on a group is logged with a timestamp of the people that did it. groups admins can download this log at any point. The log, images and videos for each group are backed up in each admin's storage and can only be deleted by a user after they have left a group. Eash admin's storage is taken up by everything put into a group.

Calendar
Regular looking calendar like google calendar iphone app. (default week view of current)
The month name and last 2 digits of the year is always shown at the top. and can be clicked on to change the month and year.
Selector in the top left for month, week or day view."
Swiping left or right will increase or decrees months of the month view, weeks in the week view or days on the day view. This needs to be 40% of the screen swipe and will have a springy animation.
All swipes up,down,left or right only happen 1 at a time with the direction the swipe started being the swipe action taking place. e.g if i was to start swiping down and them move my finger left without taking it off the screen the only swiping action/movement  that would take place is the up and down movement.
"+" button in the top right takes you to the Even type selection component
Editing a saved event will need other admin approval.
Each day in all the calendar view components has the events on the right as boxes corresponding to the times the event is on. it cannot be less than 1 pixel high.
Each day in all the calendar view components has coloured lines on the left showing the children and the member or other responsible for them at that time.
Each line is the members icon colour.
The lines will always take up the left half of the day. with no gap between a child and responsibility line. But there is a small gap between each child and responsibility parring. This means the lines will get thinner and wider depending on how many different children and people or "other" are responsible for them.
Each day shows the full day from 12am at the top to 11:59pm at the bottom line form. It is the timeline that the coloured lines are along. 
The current day is highlighted in every view. 

ExampleA: Child (red) is with Mum (blue) the entire week. The only "child responsibility event" starts at Tuesday 12pm (noon) when Dad (green) starts to be responsible for them. This event ends on Wednesday at 4pm when Mum takes back responsibility. When looking both Tuesday and Wednesday in any view the fist 1/4 from left to right is a Red line representing the child. On the Tuesday half way down the day the second line changes from blue to green as the responsibility changed from Mum to Dad at noon. On the Wednesday the second line changes from green back to blue about 16/24ths down the day. as the responsibility changed from Dad to Mum at 4pm.

ExampleB: Child1 (red), Child2 (yellow) start the day with Dad (green). They both go to school (purple) at 8am. At 2pm Child1 is picked up by mum (blue) for a doctor's appointment. at 3pm Child2 goes to after school care (pink). at 4pm Child2 is picked up by mum and both children spend the night with mum. Because there are 2 children the first line is red (Child1) and the 3rd is yellow (Child2) the entire day. The 2nd line is the person or "other" responsible for child1 and the 4th line is the person or "other" responsible for child2. So the 2nd line is green till 8/24ths down the day where it changes to purple. 14/24ths down it changes to Blue for the rest of the day. The 4th line is green till 8/24ths down the day where it changes to purple. 15/24ths down it changes to pink. 16/24ths down it changes to Blue for the rest of the day.

Child and responsibility line pop up component
Taping on a line will bring up a pop up rectangle the colour of the line with start time at the top, the end time a the bottom and the name of the child or responsibility as well as the member icon in the middle.
An edit button on the top right will take you the corresponding "Create child responsibility event component" in edit mode.
tapping again on the pop up would make it disappear.

Calendar Day View component
One day is shown with the date in the top left and M,TU,W,TH,F,SA,SU above the dates.
24hrs is a scrollable / up and down swipe-able section that is about 250% the height of the component space. Each hour is on the left most side, 1am, 2am, 3 am and so on till 11pm. 12am is not shown at eather the top or the bottom. The main calendar space that has the child and responsibility lines takes and events takes up all the space the hour text dosn't and has a background of horizontal lines for each hour, the hours text taking up the left 20%. 
Long pressing on an hr in this view with first highlight that hr and then open "Even type selection component" to create an even or child responsibility event and pass thin info to prefill the start time and end time 1hr after the start time.

Calendar Week View component
Day and week view look alike with the up and down scrollable day with the hours on the left. The weak view makes the hours text only take up 10% of the left side of the component. and there are now vertical lines in the background between each day. 
One week is shown with the dates along the top and M,TU,W,TH,F,SA,SU above the dates.
Long pressing on an hr in this view with first highlight that hr and then open "Even type selection component" to create an even or child responsibility event and pass thin info to prefill the start time and end time 1hr after the start time.

Calendar Month view component
Long pressing on an day in this view with first highlight that hr and then open "Even type selection component" to create an event or child responsibility event and pass thin info to prefill the start time as the current time to the last hour and end time 1hr after the start time.
Short pressing on a day in the month view will take you to the "Calendar Day View component"
M,TU,W,TH,F,SA,SU across the top. 
Then a grid taking up the maximum amount of space full width. The grid is 7 left to right (columns) for each day of the week and 6 down (rows) making more than enough days for each month. The 1st of the month is always on the first row on the right day of the week.
Unlike the week and day view the Child and responsibility lines are at the top running left to right of each day and are unbroken between days. but they work in the same way. showing a timeline for each child and responsibility line pairing.
The events in the month view take up the bottom half of each day.

Example on approval of payment received a message will say @"member payed to" has confirmed resiving the payment of {amount with denomination} from @"members name".  and a time stamp. This will also update the Finance matters info. taking the amount away from the amount the members that received the payment needs to pay and adding it to the member that sent the money.

Example of Finance matter:  Member A makes a payment for kids shoes. They make a Finance matter adding Member B asking them to pay for half. The expected bars show %50 for both members. The currently paid show Member A %100 and Member B %0. Member B transfers %50 to Member A and makes a "report of payment" attracting the recipe image. Member A confirms the payment when they see the money in their back account. The currently paid info updates to %50 to both members. The Finance matter can be closed without problems.

Report payment component
This is just a form asking for the amount paid and an image of the receipt of payment and the member payed to.

**CRITICAL: Cannot report overpayment - validation required**
- System validates: payment amount ≤ amount owed by paying member
- If overpayment attempted, show error: "Payment amount ($X) exceeds what you owe ($Y). Please enter $Y or less."
- Rationale: Prevents accounting confusion and disputes
- Workaround: If overpaid by mistake, create separate finance matter requesting refund
- Example: Owe $50 but paid $100 → Create new finance matter "Overpayment refund - $50" where other person owes you $50

  2. **Link with passcode** - Anyone with link + 6-digit passcode can view
  3. **Group only** - Only accessible via app to members of this group
- System generates:
  - Unique shareable web URL (e.g., parentinghelperapp.com/registry/abc123xyz)
  - 6-digit passcode (if passcode option selected, e.g., "482915")

**Registry Management** (Creator + Admins only):
- View/copy shareable web link (available repeatedly, not one-time use)
- Reset passcode (generates new random 6-digit code)

```
gift_registries table:
  - registry_id (UUID, primary key)
  - group_id (UUID, foreign key)
  - creator_id (UUID, foreign key to group_members)
  - name (VARCHAR)
  - sharing_type (ENUM: public, passcode, group_only)
  - passcode (VARCHAR, nullable, 6 digits)
  - web_token (VARCHAR, unique, for URL)
  - created_at, updated_at

gift_items table:
  - item_id (UUID, primary key)
  - registry_id (UUID, foreign key)
  - title (VARCHAR, required)
  - link (TEXT, nullable)
  - photo_url (TEXT, nullable)
  - cost (DECIMAL, nullable)
  - description (TEXT, nullable)
  - created_at, updated_at
```

**Security Considerations**:
- Web tokens must be cryptographically random (not sequential IDs)
- Passcodes are stored in plain text (they're not security-critical, just convenience)
- Rate limiting on public web view to prevent scraping
- No authentication required for public/passcode links (by design)
- Group-only registries require app authentication

**Example User Flows**:

**Flow 1: Creating a public registry**
1. User taps "Gift Registry" from group dashboard
2. Taps "Create Registry" button
3. Enters name: "Emma's 10th Birthday"
4. Selects "Public with link"
5. Taps "Create"
6. System generates: parentinghelperapp.com/registry/x7k9m2p
7. User adds gifts: "Nintendo Switch", "Pokemon Cards", "Art Supplies"
8. User shares link via text message to grandparents

**Flow 2: Viewing a passcode-protected registry**
